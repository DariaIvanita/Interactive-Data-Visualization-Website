The World Health Organization (WHO) and global researchers began pushing for greater awareness and policy changes to address these issues.`;

Lockdowns, social isolation, and economic uncertainty contributed to deteriorating mental well-being.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) have revolutionized mental health therapy, making treatment more personalized and accessible.
