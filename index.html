            In 1990, approximately 350 million people globally were estimated to be affected by mental health disorders. This included a wide range of conditions such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and more. Mental health was beginning to emerge as a significant public health issue, though the social stigma around these conditions still made it difficult for many to seek help. Despite this, studies from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health bodies started to uncover the global burden mental health disorders were placing on individuals, families, and societies. At the time, access to mental health care was limited in many parts of the world, with many countries lacking sufficient resources or infrastructure to address the growing need for services. The 1990s marked the beginning of greater recognition of mental health as a major health issue, but there was still a long way to go before it would be treated with the urgency and focus it requires.

            By 2001, the global awareness of mental health had expanded significantly, with a reported 450 million people worldwide suffering from mental or neurological disorders. This increase in prevalence was attributed to a growing understanding of the wide-reaching impact of mental health conditions and a better ability to diagnose them. At this point, the World Health Organization (WHO) had expanded its work in the mental health field, calling for international efforts to improve mental health care systems. However, the global mental health community faced significant challenges, including the need for more funding, specialized mental health professionals, and effective strategies to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness. In many countries, particularly low- and middle-income nations, mental health resources were still inadequate, and many people continued to suffer in silence due to a lack of understanding and support. While significant strides were made in terms of global awareness, much remained to be done to provide accessible mental health care for everyone, everywhere.

            In 2010, the number of people affected by mental health disorders remained at approximately 450 million globally. During this period, mental health care began to see improvements in terms of awareness, treatment options, and the development of mental health policies. However, significant gaps remained, especially in low-income regions where mental health services were still not widely available or were severely underfunded. Advances in psychiatry, psychology, and therapy began to provide more effective treatments for those suffering from mental health conditions, but there were still considerable barriers to accessing care, including cost, social stigma, and a lack of trained professionals. By this time, mental health had gained more attention from global organizations, and there were increasing calls to prioritize mental health care at both national and international levels. In some countries, mental health was beginning to be integrated into broader health initiatives, but these efforts were often fragmented, and the quality of care varied greatly between regions.

            In 2020, mental health disorders reached a global prevalence of approximately 100 million people affected. This marked a significant increase due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated mental health challenges around the world. The pandemicâ€™s isolation, uncertainty, economic hardship, and health concerns led to an uptick in conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Additionally, the healthcare systems in many countries were overwhelmed, and mental health services were often deprioritized. The global mental health crisis reached new levels as millions of individuals experienced stress, burnout, and depression, with many struggling to access the care they needed. This period highlighted the urgent need for more comprehensive, accessible, and long-term mental health support systems. Governments, healthcare providers, and communities began to recognize the long-lasting effects of the pandemic on mental health, and as a result, discussions around mental health policy, support systems, and funding became central to global conversations on public health. The pandemic underscored how crucial mental health is to overall well-being, and it sparked a global movement to prioritize mental health resources and care in the years to come.

            In 2025, mental health continues to be a major concern, affecting millions across the globe. In the U.S., about 1 in 5 adults experience mental health challenges each year. Suicide rates have tragically reached a record high, with more than 49,000 lives lost in 2022 alone. The stress on parents is particularly severe, with 90% reporting sleep deprivation due to caregiving responsibilities, 80% in tears over it, and nearly 30% even considering suicide. To tackle these challenges, different approaches are being explored. In the U.K., NHS England is focused on reducing long wait times for mental health services, even if it means revising improvement targets. Workplaces are also shifting focus from traditional wellness programs to more personalized strategies to support employees' mental well-being. Communities are taking action as well, with organizations like Momentum Mental Health organizing events such as the Resilience Trek along the Kokoda Trail to raise awareness and funds for mental health services. Though significant progress is being made, much work remains to ensure mental health gets the attention it deserves and that resources are improved for those who need them most.
