        <h1>Mental Health History: 1990 to 2025</h1>

        <div id="year1990" class="year-details">
            <h2>Year 1990</h2>
            <p>In 1990, mental health was gaining more media coverage, and significant policy shifts began in many countries to address mental health as a serious societal issue. However, mental health disorders were still stigmatized in many areas of the world, and the mental health workforce was often inadequate.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="year2001" class="year-details">
            <h2>Year 2001</h2>
            <p>During this year, mental health was discussed more openly in some parts of the world, and the global conversation about mental health issues began to expand. However, despite progress, there were still many gaps in treatment access and stigma persisted.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="year2010" class="year-details">
            <h2>Year 2010</h2>
            <p>By 2010, mental health awareness had significantly increased due to social media campaigns and documentaries, but mental health services remained inaccessible in many regions, and mental health issues were still poorly funded in many places.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="year2020" class="year-details">
            <h2>Year 2020</h2>
            <p>The year 2020 saw a sharp increase in mental health issues globally, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns, social isolation, and economic uncertainty led to an overwhelming number of cases of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Telehealth options expanded as people sought treatment online. Mental health became a central topic in both public health discussions and workplace policies, signaling a shift toward more integrated mental health support systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="year2025" class="year-details">
            <h2>Year 2025</h2>
            <p>By 2025, mental health was likely to have an increased level of awareness across the globe, with an emphasis on preventive care, access to therapy, and the integration of mental health services within primary care settings. More countries would have enacted comprehensive mental health policies, with the potential to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness.</p>
