            "1990": "In 1990, approximately 350 million people worldwide were affected by mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. At this time, mental health was highly stigmatized, and access to care was extremely limited. Many countries lacked proper mental health policies, leading to inadequate treatment options. The World Health Organization (WHO) and global researchers began pushing for greater awareness and policy changes.",
            
            "2001": "By 2001, the number of people affected by mental health disorders had risen to 450 million. Advances in psychiatry and increased public awareness led to improved diagnosis rates, though many individuals still faced barriers to treatment due to stigma and financial constraints. The World Health Report 2001 emphasized mental health as a global priority, encouraging nations to integrate mental health care into their public health systems.",
            
            "2010": "In 2010, mental health remained a major global challenge, with around 450 million people affected. The rise of digital mental health tools, such as online therapy and mobile mental wellness apps, started gaining traction. However, access to mental health care was still unequal, with lower-income countries struggling to provide sufficient resources. Suicide prevention campaigns and discussions around work-life balance became more prominent in mental health discourse.",
            
            "2020": "By 2020, the global number of individuals affected by mental health disorders exceeded 1 billion. The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact, leading to sharp increases in anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders. Lockdowns, social isolation, and economic uncertainty contributed to deteriorating mental well-being. Governments and organizations expanded online therapy options and helplines, recognizing the urgent need for accessible mental health support. Workplace mental health programs also gained attention, with many companies adopting remote work policies to reduce stress and burnout.",
            
            "2025": "As of 2025, an estimated 1.2 billion people worldwide are living with mental health disorders. The long-term effects of the pandemic, increasing social and economic stressors, and the growing prevalence of mental health discussions in mainstream media have all contributed to this figure. Advances in artificial intelligence and virtual reality have revolutionized mental health therapy, making treatment more personalized and accessible. Many countries have also implemented stronger mental health policies, increasing funding for psychiatric care and reducing barriers to access. Despite progress, the global mental health crisis remains a significant issue, requiring continued research, policy development, and stigma reduction efforts."
